## Sources for Rezi.one

Rezi's sources are extremely important. They determine the quality and trustworthiness of the site. Without the sources, Rezi.one is nothing. Rezi's sources are chosen by quality of the site, trust of the site, and download performance of the site. This list is always changing and will continue to as websites die, new websites pop up, or websites change their function.

This list is in no particular order. If a site is on here, it is trusted by the community and safe to download from. If a site is not on this list, it may be because it is unsafe, or just not on this list, you decide.

For full urls go to [https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/blob/main/input.json](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/blob/main/input.json). Some may be in [https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/tree/main/scraper/spiders](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/tree/main/scraper/spiders) too.
