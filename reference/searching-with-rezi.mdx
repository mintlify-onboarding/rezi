## Meilisearch

Rezi is built on [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/). Meilisearch is a great search engine built in Rust for ultimate speed. Along with Rezi, I also use Meilisearch for the [Rakun](https://rakun.app) search engine, a pirated anime search engine. They are a great company and have really created a great product. They have acknowledged Rezi and Rakun, and I'm very grateful for them not kicking either product off their platform.

**Because everything is based on Meilisearch, this documentation is a bit short. For more documentation on the extent of use and details for Meilisearch (as well as usage for other languages), read [their documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs).**
